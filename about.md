<br/>
My passion is to innovatively design processes which will generate business intelligence or actionable strategy from data-driven analytical methodology.

With strong experience in Data, I would love to create insightful analysis by using analytical, statistical, visualized, machine learning as tools and weapons. I have developed multiple open source web-based BI and analytical tool to generate business insights with visualization and machine learning. Experience different analytical projects, I excel my Python and R skill, focusing on data analysis (Pandas, Numpy), digital marketing (GA, Adwords, GTM, FB ads), database(SQL, Salesforce SQOL), web-based application(Plotly, Flask), visualization(Tableau, PowerBI, Google Data Studio, D3.js)
