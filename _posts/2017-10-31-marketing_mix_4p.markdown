When I studied digital marketing at Northwestern, a course I really love is called "Marketing Mix Analysis." Marketing Mix is a term often used by marketor, and it is defined clearly, which is 'set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target.' I personally have a easier definition I learnt from the class is that 'marketing mix is a combination of marketing methods, which provides specific marekting strategy.

Generally speaking, Product and Place are farely straight forward to understand. No mater it is a tangible product or intangible service, product is the first thing marketors would like to focus on and defferciate from their competitors most of the time. Some people might feel confused Promotion and Price, becuase Promotion sounds like sales promotion or discount. But in here, promotion are more like a bigger picture of using methods to advertise, promote, PR the product, service, company, idea, etc. Promotion needs longer time and investment, as well as long term plan compared to Price.
